# iitisoc_face_mask_detection_kaggle
The aim of the project is to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not by using machine learning. This can be done by with the help of a CNN (convolutional neural network https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. The model is created easily by using Keras Sequential. The model is trained on a dataset containing many images. Once the model is trained we can use it to predict the images. The parameters accuracy and loss tell us how good or bad a model is. These parameters primarily depend on the model's architecture and on the data being used to train the model. The presentation attached gives brief overview of the project. You can find the code for the project in the python notebook that has been attached along with the detailed execution log. This project idea could be of potential use like in face mask screening at public places which is quite important in these covid-times.
